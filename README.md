The site is designed for patients who have undergone elective surgery and require advice, reassurance, and access to a healthcare professional. At this stage, the platform will focus solely on supporting patients recovering from straightforward elective surgeries.

As a physiotherapist, I recognize a clear need for follow up care once a patient has been discharged from hospital. Many patients feel anxious or uncertain during the early stages of recovery. This platform aims to provide them with quick and easy access to a physiotherapist who can offer guidance, reassurance, and, if necessary, escalate any concerns related to their post-operative health.
