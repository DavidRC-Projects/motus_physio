| Feature | Testing Performed | Result | Pass/Fail |

| Active State Highlighting | Check if current page is highlighted | Current page navigation showing active state | Pass |
| Time Field | Click on time field | Time picker opens | Pass |




Fix:
When logged out i clicked on the view-bookings page and it came up with the following error: TypeError at /view-booking/
Field 'id' expected a number but got <SimpleLazyObject: <django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser object at 0x107d73980>>.

This was fixed by adding @login required for the booking_calendar_view function in the views.py.

No CSS styles applied for active nav bar link. Added this to underline in white when page is active.

time input in the appointment booking form did not allow input. Checked code in index.html and its inputtype was date and not time. This worked after chaning this.
